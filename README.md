# DevScale Platform

DevScale is a production-style Kubernetes platform deployed on AWS using Infrastructure as Code, GitOps, and cloud-native observability.

The platform provisions infrastructure with Terraform, deploys workloads through ArgoCD GitOps, exposes services through an NGINX ingress controller, and provides monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.

---

# Architecture

Terraform provisions AWS infrastructure including:

- VPC
- Networking
- Amazon EKS Cluster
- Worker Nodes

Applications are deployed into Kubernetes through GitOps using ArgoCD.

Monitoring is handled by Prometheus and visualized with Grafana dashboards.

External traffic enters the platform through an NGINX ingress controller backed by an AWS LoadBalancer.
